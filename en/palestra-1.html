            <h2>Test Smells: Light to Expose, Camera to Analyze, Action to Remove</h2>
            <p> <strong>Abstract: </strong>
                Test smells are symptoms in the test code that indicate possible design or implementation problems. The lack of quality in tests can raise problems such as increased maintenance costs, difficulty in understanding and modifying tests, reduced test reliability, higher likelihood of missing bugs, and decreased confidence in the software's overall quality. In this context, recent research has shown that this whole package of quality problems also applies to manual tests, i.e., tests written in natural language. This way, like automated tests, manual tests also smell.

                In this talk, we will deeply navigate throughout test smells present in automated and natural languages tests under multiple perspectives.

                We will start by exploring catalogues of test smells, discussing the names, definitions, examples, and consequences of each smell. Next, we will examine whether these smells are genuinely harmful. Afterwards, strategies on how to identify these smells will be presented. The strategies include ways to identify smells in automated tests (i.e., in xUnit frameworks such as GoogleTest, pytest and JUnit) and in manual tests. For automated tests, we will indicate the use of test code templates, while for manual tests, we will leverage advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
                
                Once we have established that these test issues are indeed problematic and identified ways to detect them, we will turn our attention to catalogues of transformations designed to eliminate these smells from both automated and manual tests. We will present evaluations from software testing professionals, who provided insights on the severity of these smells and the effectiveness of the proposed transformations.

                The talk will focus on real-practice automated and manual tests and also will discuss open challenges and research opportunities.
